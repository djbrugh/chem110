\section{Content}
This course is a survey of the principles of chemistry, including atomic and molecular structure, stoichiometry, chemical reactions, chemical bonding, thermochemistry, and states of matter. The course topics are listed below. Topics are not necessarily covered in this order, and not all topics are covered with equal depth.

%
\section{Goals}
Chemistry provides a microscopic view of the Universe that is applicable to any discipline. Phenomena as different as the ozone hole over the South Pole and Earth's magnetism are given common ground in chemistry where the properties and interactins of atoms and molecules give rise to all observed macroscopic phenomena. Chemistry makes the Universe understandable and interpretable. Simply put, it is extraordinarily cool. 

I want to share some of this with you. During this course I want to 
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (a\upshape)]
\item provide you with the tools necessary to form a realistic mental image of the microscopic world of atoms and molecules,
\item provide you with the tools necessary to understand what a chemist does,
\item provide you with the tools to continue your education in chemistry,
\item develop your ability to analyze and interpret experimental results from a chemist's point of view,
\item help you understand how we know what we know, and
\item improve your problem solving skills.
\end{inparaenum}

Another important goal of the course is to improve your study skills. I want you to learn to be efficient and effective in your studying so that you can get more done in less time. By the end of the course, I would like academic success to be an automatic part of your life, not something you have to struggle to achieve. 
%
% --- LEARNING OBJECTIVES ---
%
\section{Learning Objectives}
Learning objectives are the things you should be able to do at the end of the course. For each topic covered in this course, you are provided with a detailed list of learning objectives called Be Able Tos, or BATS for short. A complete list of detailed BATS for each course topic can be found at \href{http://dephlo.net/chem110/lecture/objectives}{dephlo.net/genchem-objectives}. These BATS are very detailed (granular), and it might be difficult to see the overall objectives of the course from them. 

A higher level (less granular) list of learning objectives might be helpful. At the end of the course, you should be able to 
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (a\upshape)]
\item use the SI unit system proficiently; 
\item define, recognize, and distinguish, atoms, elements, compounds, molecules, mixtures, and solutions; 
\item predict chemical reactions, balance chemical equations, and predict reaction yields in any phase of matter; 
\item explain the atomic structure of matter and how it defines the periodic table of the elements; 
\item state periodic trends in atomic properties and use them to predict trends in molecular properties; 
\item predict how atoms bond to form molecules and draw realistic three-dimensional structures of molecules; and
\item predict energy changes associated with chemical and physical changes.
\end{inparaenum}
\section{Time Requirement}

Each of the four weekly course meetings is 50 minutes in length, requiring a total of $3.33$ hours per week. For each meeting you can expect to spend at least $2$ hours outside of class reading, studying, and working exercises. If your study habits are not well-developed, this course may require more time outside of class. You will have to devote time to working exercises over weekends and University breaks. 
%
% --- WEEKLY ROUTINE ---
%
\section{Weekly Routine}
This course is primarily lecture-based. Each lecture meeting has a topic and an assigned reading which can be found on the course website. You prepare for lecture by reading the assigned reading. A homework assignment on Sapling Learning is due each Friday. Review meetings are offered every Wednesday evening. There will be four quizzes and three exams during the semester, and you will have the option to rework them if you do not perform as well as you would like. 
%
% --- THINGS I GRADE ---
%
\section{Things I Grade}
You and I determine your progress in this course using the scores derived from evaluating the quality and accuracy of your answers to questions posed in homework, quizzes, and exams. This section provides details for each of these.
%
% --- Practice Exercises ---
%
\subsection{Homework} 
Homework is assigned and due each Friday on the Sapling Learning website. Questions are added to each homework assignment as the week progresses. Please check the Sapling Learning site every night for homework updates. Your lowest two (2) homework scores are dropped before calculating your course score. 
%
% --- Quizzes ---
%
\subsection{Quizzes}
Quiz dates are listed in the course schedule on the course website. Each is worth 25 points. They are administered at the start of a normal class meeting and typically require 20 minutes to complete. The material covered on each quiz is listed on the course website. Solutions for quizzes are posted on the course website after the quizzes are graded. A practice quiz is available for each quiz, and you may take a follow up quiz to replace any quiz score. 
%
% --- Exams ---
%
\subsection{Exams}
Exam dates are listed in the course schedule on the course website. Each is worth 100 points. Three exams are given during the semester. They are administered at the start of a normal class meeting. The material covered on each exam is listed on the course website. Solutions are posted on the course website after all exams have been graded. You may take a follow up quiz to replace any exam score. 
%
% --- Final Exam ---
%
\subsection{Final Exam}
The \marginnote{-0.1in}{The final exam is given at the time specified by the Registrar. I have no control over this time.} final exam is three hours in length, and it is cumulative over the entire semester. No solutions to the final exam are posted, and you are not allowed to take your final exam with you after I grade it. You may review the grading by making an appointment with me, but you may not take possession of the exam.
%
% --- LABORATORY SCORES ---
%
\section{Laboratory Scores}
Your \marginnote{-0.1in}{I do not adjust laboratory scores. What you earn as a percentage is what will be included in your course score.} laboratory instructor is responsible for evaluating your laboratory work. He or she will assign a score to your laboratory work, and at the end of the course I will convert your laboratory score to a percentage that is included in the computation of your course score.
%
% --- COURSE SCORE ---
%
\section{Course Score}
Your course score is a weighted average of the scores you earn on exams, quizzes, homework, and laboratory work. These scores are weighted according to the percentages shown in Table~\ref{tab:weights}. Before calculating your course score, \marginnote{-0.1in}{Your lowest 2 homework scores are dropped.} I will throw away your lowest two (2) homework scores.
